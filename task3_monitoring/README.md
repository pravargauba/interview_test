Prometheus has a central component called the Prometheus server that collects the metrics from different nodes. Prometheus server uses the concept of scraping by contacting the target systemâ€™s metric endpoints to fetch data at regular intervals.

We can monitor hundreds of EC2 or GCP VM's by leveraging node exporter.

Node Exporter
So to monitor a Linux machine we need a Node Exporter that is used to pull Linux system metrics like CPU load and disk I/O. Node Exporter will expose these as Prometheus-style metrics.
